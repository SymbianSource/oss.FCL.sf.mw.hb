    \class HbContinuousFeedback

    \brief Tool class for continuous feedback effects.

    Continuous feedbacks are used to play sound and haptic effects that last as long as the user is touching the screen,
    for example when dragging an interface object, scrolling a list or a slider. Continuous feedback
    effects need to be started, updated and cancelled during the life time of the feedback using methods
    HbFeedbackPlayer::startContinuousFeedback(), HbFeedbackPlayer::updateContinuousFeedback() and
    HbFeedbackPlayer::cancelContinuousFeedback(). The effect intensity can be varied during the feedback.
*/

    \fn void HbContinuousFeedback::setContinuousEffect(HbFeedback::ContinuousEffect effect)

    be played when calling HbFeedbackPlayer::startContinuousFeedback(). The actual effects are
    defined in the device themes.
