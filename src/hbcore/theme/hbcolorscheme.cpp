    \class HbColorScheme
    \brief HbColorScheme class is used to query colors from theme.

    HbColorScheme class has a single static functions to query colors from theme. 
     
     \sa QColor HbColorScheme::color(const QString &colorRole)
     
    This method is appropriate for custom widgets which want to be consistent with standard 
    look and feel and be themable. For example, a custom widget may want to have background color 
    same as that of HbDialog. In such scenario the widget can query standard "popupbackground" color
    from theme.
    Following code queries color of popoup forground and applies it to a text item.
    \code
    QColor col = HbColorScheme::color("popupforeground");
    if (col.isValid()) {
       mytextitem->setTextColor(col);
    }
    \endcode
    
    Note:  
       - Theming framework schedules redraw for all graphics items when theme changes, so widgets 
    need not to do it again by themselves. It is sufficient that widgets make sure that colors being
    used to paint the graphics item has been updated in the handler of HbEvent::ThemeChanged.
       
       - The color-role may contain information about the state also, e.g. "foreground_enabled".
    
    \warning List of standard color roles is not yet finalized
