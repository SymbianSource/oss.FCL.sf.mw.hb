    \class HbDeviceDialog
    \brief HbDeviceDialog displays a dialog on top of all running applications
    
    Device Dialogs are used to display information, queries and alerts for the device rather than
    for an application. Some example device dialogs are:
    - Low battery
    - Low memory
    - Incoming bluetooth message
    - Text message received
    
    Due to the importance of these dialogs they are
    displayed on top of all applications. The HbDeviceDialog class provides the client
    interface for creating these dialogs. This differs from other dialog classes such as 
    HbMessageBox in that 
    HbDeviceDialog is not a widget but is the interface to a framework that handles the dialogs.
    
    \section _framework Device Dialog Framework
    
    Any application is able to generate device dialogs. However, in
    order to display the dialogs on top of all applications, the device dialog framework 
    uses a server. To display a dialog an application uses the HbDeviceDialog client interface to send requests for
    dialogs to the server. The HbDeviceDialog class can also be used or extended as part of a set of specialization classes
    to create different device dialog types. 
    
    Device dialog widgets are implemented in plugins loaded by the server.

    Shown below is a runtime view of the device dialog framework.

    <b>Platform dependent.</b> Currently server is implemented only for Symbian platform. On other platforms,
    device dialog are displayed on client's mainwindow.

    HbDeviceDialog has no dependencies to other parts of the framework. Only to Qt. Thus it can be used
    also from engine components that have no user interface.

    \section _types Types of device dialogs

    There are three classes of device dialogs:
     -# Generic device dialogs are displayed on top
    of all applications, except in the case of an incoming call. Examples of these are a "Low memory"
    message box and a "Receive message via bluetooth?" query. 
     -# Device notification dialogs are
    notifications displayed in the top left corner of the display. Examples are "New message" and
    "Low battery" notifications. 
     -# The Universal indicator menu shows enhanced status indicator
    information.

    Generic device dialogs and the indicator menu interrupt the current foreground application.
    The user cannot interact with the application with a touch or keyboard until the dialog
    is dismissed. Device notification dialogs behave differently allowing interaction with the
    current foreground application.

    Device dialog widgets are constructed dynamically by the device dialog service. Construction
    takes two parameters: a type and a set of parameters appropriate to the dialog type.
    The device dialog type is a unique string identifying the
    dialog. A search is made to find a plugin that can instantiate the requested
    dialog. The service loads the plugin and creates an instance of the widget.

    The parameter set is encapsulated in QMap<QString, QVariant>. Each device dialog implementation has
    a default value for all parameters. Only parameters that differ from the default need to be
    given. Parameters are <name, value> pairs. How the parameters are used depends on
    the plugin implementing the dialog. Suggested usage is <name, value> used as property
    name and value pairs of the dialog implementation. This makes it easy to set properties using
    QObject::setProperty(const char*, const QVariant&). If data types supported by QVariant are
    not suitable for a specific device dialog, Q_DECLARE_METATYPE can be used to add data types.

    %Data can be sent to a device dialog after it has been launched using the update() function. %Data
    sent by the dialog is received by the dataReceived signal. A copy of the last data received
    is held by the class and can be fetched by a call to the receivedData() function. This allows data to be received
    without having to connect to a signal by waiting for a dialog to close and then
    getting the received data.

    It is possible to launch multiple device dialogs from a single HbDeviceDialog object.
    However if there is a need to update a dialog or receive data from it, only the last dialog
    launched supports this. In this case instantiate the HbDeviceDialog class for each device dialog
    that needs communication (update or data receive) after a launch.

    HbDeviceDialog::show() method returns after the device dialog service has accepted the dialog.
    The service decides when the dialog is actually displayed. If there is no need to receive
    data from the dialog widget, the HbDeviceDialog object can be destroyed after the show() method returns
    (can be allocated in a stack). A function is provided to wait for the device dialog to be dismissed,
    making the dialog display synchronous.

    If any signals of HbDeviceDialog are connected, then the instance needs to exist until the
    dialog is dismissed. In this case the device dialog service will close all dialogs
    launched by the instance when it is deleted making it inappropriate to allocate HbDeviceDialog
    into a stack.

    Several clients can share the same device dialog widget by agreeing on an unique tag. See
    HbDeviceDialogWidgetPlugin for more information.

    When the HbDeviceDialog object is created, it can reserve a communication channel to the device dialog
    service or the channel creation may be delayed until show(). This is controlled by a constructor
    flag. The default is the delayed resource reservation.

    The HbDeviceDialog class is not thread safe. If cancel() needs to called across threads, a queued
    signal slot connection can be used.
    
    \section _usecases Using the HbDeviceDialog class
    
    The code below launches a device dialog and continues execution
    \code
    // Launch a device dialog and continue execution.

    HbDeviceDialog deviceDialog;
    QVariantMap parameters;
    parameters.insertMulti(QString("text"), QVariant(QString("Warning text")));
    const char *deviceDialogType = "hb.devdlg.examplemessagebox/1.0";
    deviceDialog.show(QString(deviceDialogType), parameters);
    \endcode

    The code below demonstrates how to use HbDeviceDialog as a member variable and connect signals before launching the device dialog
    \code
    // Connect signals and launch a device dialog.

    connect(mDeviceDialog, SIGNAL(dataReceived(QVariantMap)),
        this, SLOT(dataReceived(QVariantMap)));
    connect(mDeviceDialog, SIGNAL(deviceDialogClosed()), this, SLOT(deviceDialogClosed()));
    connect(mDeviceDialog, SIGNAL(error(int)), this, SLOT(error(int)));
    QVariantMap parameters;
    mDeviceDialog.show(QString("hb.devdlg.examplequery/1.0"), parameters);
    \endcode    
    
    The code below shows how to wait until a dialog has closed
    \code
    // Below code launches a query and then waits for it to close.

    // Launch query
    HbDeviceDialog deviceDialog;
    QVariantMap parameters;
    deviceDialog.show(QString("hb.devdlg.samplequery/1.0"), parameters);
    // Wait for note to close
    deviceDialog.waitForClosed();
    // Get data the dialog sent
    QVariantMap data = deviceDialog.receivedData();
    \endcode
