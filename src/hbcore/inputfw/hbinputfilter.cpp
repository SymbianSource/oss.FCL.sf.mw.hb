\class HbInputFilter
\brief Abstract base class for all editor filters.

An input filter knows how to answer one question: "Is given character legal?". It does not do postion based
validation in same way as QValidator but is much simpler position independent filter.

Input filter can be asigned to an editor through editor interface. Input method implementations should always
honor installed filter and never commit characters that do not pass active filter (all the methods in
HbInputFocusObject API do that automatically).

\sa HbEditorInterface
*/

/*!
\fn virtual bool filter(QChar character) = 0

Returns true if given character is valid.
*/

/*!
Performs filtering operation for string "in". Filtered string "out" is a copy of "in" without
invalid characters.
*/
void HbInputFilter::filterString(const QString &in, QString &out)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < in.length(); i++) {
        if (filter(in[i])) {
            out.append(in[i]);
        }
    }
