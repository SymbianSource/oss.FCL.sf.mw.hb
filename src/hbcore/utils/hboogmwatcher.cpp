  non-visible HbIconItem instances, whenever the low-graphics-memory event is
  received.

  critical limit. Note that this has nothing to do with the amount of free
  system memory (RAM). When this signal is emitted, all entities, that have
  anything to do with graphics memory, are expected to perform as much cleanup
  as possible in order to increase the amount of free graphics memory.
